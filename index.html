            <h2>History of France</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <p style="text-align: center;">France has a rich and dynamic history that has shaped its identity and global influence. Its roots trace back to the Celtic Gauls before becoming part of the Roman Empire in 51 BCE. The fall of Rome led to the rise of the Frankish kingdom under leaders like Charlemagne, who was crowned Emperor in 800 CE. In the Middle Ages, France was a center of feudalism and played a key role in the Crusades, while conflicts like the Hundred Years’ War with England defined much of its medieval history.

                        The French Revolution of 1789 marked a turning point, overthrowing the monarchy and championing ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. This revolution inspired movements worldwide and led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who established a vast empire before his eventual defeat in 1815. The 19th century saw France shift between monarchy, republics, and empires, culminating in the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870.
                        
                        In the 20th century, France played a significant role in both World Wars, suffering heavy losses but emerging as a victorious power. The post-war period saw economic recovery and the establishment of the European Union, with France as a founding member. Today, France remains a leading global power, celebrated for its contributions to democracy, culture, and international cooperation.</p>
